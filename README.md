# JetsProject
### Description
This program is fleet management application for a diverse set of jets, each with unique capabilities. This application features an interactive menu that allows users to access detailed information such as; price, range, speed, and model, and utilize various functionalities of their jets like loading cargo and refueling. The application is structured with an abstract base class for jets, extended by specialized classes like PassengerJet and two other custom classes(cargo jets and refueling jets) implementing distinct interfaces. Users can view and manage the fleet, with options to list all jets, fly them, identify the fastest or longest-range jet, load cargo, refuel other jets, and add or remove jets from the fleet. The project follows a series of user stories guiding the implementation, from initializing the application with a jet app class and populating an airfield with jets with an airfield class, while enabling interactive menu-driven operations.

### Lessons Learned
* I learned the importance and overall benefit of testing your code in increments. Such as when one part is done run and test to verify that it works. This is also helped me utilize "trial and error". Trying different things in a small piece of code to see what the output is and choose which one works best for my desired outcome.
